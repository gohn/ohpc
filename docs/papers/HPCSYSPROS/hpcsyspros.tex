% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\section{Introduction}
Launched initially in November 2015, and formalized as a collaborative Linux
Foundation~\cite{LinuxFoundation_url} project in June 2016, OpenHPC is a
community driven project currently comprised of over 25 member organizations
from academia, research labs, and industry. To date, the OpenHPC software stack
aggregates over 60 components ranging from administrative tools like bare-metal
provisioning and resource management to end-user development libraries that
span a range of scientific/numerical uses. OpenHPC adopts a familiar package
repository delivery model and provides customizable recipes for installing and
configuring reference designs of compute clusters.

\section{Community building blocks for HPC systems}

\subsection{Motivation}
Many HPC sites spend considerable effort aggregating a large suite of 
open-source projects to provide a capable HPC environment for their users.
It is necessary to build and deploy HPC focused packages that are either absent
or outdated in Linux distro providers. Further, local packaging or 
customization frequently tries to give software versioning access to users (e.g.
via environment modules or similar equivalent). OpenHPC is focused on 
lowering the barrier to entry for HPC by providing a collection of 
pre-packaged and validated binary components that can be used to install 
and manage HPC clusters throughout their life cycle. We also provide multiple 
system configuration recipes that leverage community reference designs and best 
practices.

OpenHPC's mission is to {\em provide a reference collection of open source HPC
software components and best practices, lowering barriers to deployment,
advancement, and use of modern HPC methods and tools}.

OpenHPC components and best practices will enable and accelerate innovation and
discoveries by broadening access to state-of-the-art, open source HPC methods
and tools in a consistent environment, supported by a collaborative, worldwide
community of HPC users, developers, administrators, and vendors.



\subsection{Governance \& Community}
Under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, OpenHPC has established a governing
board and a technical steering committee. The governing board is responsible for
budgetary oversight, intellectual property policies, marketing, and long-term
road map guidance. The technical steering committee is made up of representatives
from academia, industry, and government R\&D laboratories, and is tasked with
stack architecture, component selection, releases, and day-to-day project
maintenance.

\subsection{Conventions}
\subsubsection{Architecture}
We have assembled a variety of common ingredients required to deploy and manage 
an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource management, I/O 
libraries, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. The 
delivery mechanism is via standard package managers (i.e., there are public 
OpenHPC repositories for both yum and zypper). OpenHPC currently supports CentOS
7 and SUSE's SLE 12. A single RPM spec file generates packages for both base
operating systems. This multiple target model also extends to compiler
toolchains and MPI runtime libraries. For some components that means a spec file
can generate 12 different versions of a package. This complexity is masked by
yum/zypper convenience groups, macros within the build system, and hierarchical 
Lmod environment modules for users.

Convenience groups are prefixed with the 'ohpc-' tag, and package names have a
similar suffix. This allows for easy wild-carding with package managers, and
provides the ability to install OpenHPC-provided versions of software packages
along side of CentOS or SLE versions of the same packages.

\subsubsection{Build}

 - spec file conventions
 - git + OBS
 
\subsubsection{Test}
 To facilitate global efforts in diagnostics/validation, we have devised a standalone integration test infrastructure
 • Intent was to create families of tests that could be used during:
 - initial install process (can we build a system?)
 - post-install process (does it work?)
 - developing tests that touch all of the major components (can we compile against 3rd party libraries, will they execute under resource manager, etc)
 • Expectation is that each new component included will need corresponding integration test collateral
 • These integration tests are included in GitHub repo


\section{Conclusions \& Future work}
Some known big ticket items on the horizon for the TSC
- establishing a process and prioritization/selection process for including
new software components
- establish minimum integration test expectations
- establish packaging conventions:
• naming schemes
• dependency hierarchy management • installation paths
• upgrade/rollback? mechanisms
- road map time line for next release (and cadence strategy for future releases)
- addition of public CI infrastructure, roll out of additional architecture builds
