% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\section{Community building blocks for HPC systems}

\subsection{Motivation}
Many HPC sites spend considerable effort aggregating a large suite of
open-source projects to provide a capable HPC environment for their users.
This is frequently motivated by the necessity to build and deploy HPC focused
packages that are either absent or outdated in popular Linux
distributions. Further, local packaging or customization frequently tries to
give software versioning access to users (e.g. via environment modules or
similar equivalent).  With this background motivation in mind, combined with a
desire to minimize duplication and share best practices across sites, the OpenHPC community
project was formed with the following mission and vision principles: \\

\noindent {\bf Mission:} to 
provide a reference collection of open source HPC software components and
best practices, lowering barriers to deployment, advancement, and use of
modern HPC methods and tools.

\noindent {\bf Vision:} OpenHPC components and best practices will enable and
accelerate innovation and discoveries by broadening access to state-of-the-art,
open source HPC methods and tools in a consistent environment, supported by a
collaborative, worldwide community of HPC users, developers, administrators,
and vendors. \\

%%% OpenHPC
%%% is focused on lowering the barrier to entry for HPC by providing a collection
%%% of pre-packaged and validated binary components that can be used to install and
%%% manage HPC clusters throughout their life cycle. We also provide multiple
%%% system configuration recipes that leverage community reference designs and best
%%% practices.

The remaining sections provide a further overview of the community project
highlighting related work (\S\ref{sec:related_work}), the technical governance
structure (\S\ref{sec:governance}), repository enablement, packaging
conventions, and test harness.

\input{related_work}


\subsection{Governance \& Community} \label{sec:governance}
Under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, OpenHPC has established a two
pronged governance structure consisting of a governing board and a technical
steering committee (TSC). The governing board is responsible for budgetary
oversight, intellectual property policies, marketing, and long-term road map
guidance. The TSC drives the technical aspects of the project including stack
architecture, software component selection, builds and releases, and day-to-day
project maintenance. Individual roles within the TSC are highlighted in
Figure~\ref{fig:tsc_governance}.  These include common roles like maintainers
and testing coordinators, but also include unique HPC roles designed to ensure
influence and capture points of view from two key constituents. In particular,
the {\em component development representative(s)} are included to represent the
upstream development communities for software projects that might be integrated
with the OpenHPC packaging collection. In contrast, the {\em end-user/site
  representative(s)} are downstream recipients of OpenHPC integration efforts
and represent administrators and users of HPC systems that might leverage
OpenHPC collateral.  At present, there are nearly 20 community volunteers
serving on the TSC~\cite{TSC_url} with representation from academia, industry,
and government R\&D laboratories.

\subsection{Conventions}
\subsubsection{Architecture}
We have assembled a variety of common ingredients required to deploy and manage 
an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource management, I/O 
libraries, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. The 
delivery mechanism is via standard package managers (i.e., there are public 
OpenHPC repositories for both yum and zypper). OpenHPC currently supports CentOS
7 and SUSE's SLE 12. A single RPM spec file generates packages for both base
operating systems. This multiple target model also extends to compiler
toolchains and MPI runtime libraries. For some components that means a spec file
can generate 12 different versions of a package. This complexity is masked by
yum/zypper convenience groups, macros within the build system, and hierarchical 
Lmod environment modules for users.

Convenience groups are prefixed with the 'ohpc-' tag, and package names have a
similar suffix. This allows for easy wild-carding with package managers, and
provides the ability to install OpenHPC-provided versions of software packages
along side of CentOS or SLE versions of the same packages.

\subsubsection{Build}

 - spec file conventions
 - git + OBS
 
\subsubsection{Test}
 To facilitate global efforts in diagnostics/validation, we have devised a standalone integration test infrastructure
 • Intent was to create families of tests that could be used during:
 - initial install process (can we build a system?)
 - post-install process (does it work?)
 - developing tests that touch all of the major components (can we compile against 3rd party libraries, will they execute under resource manager, etc)
 • Expectation is that each new component included will need corresponding integration test collateral
 • These integration tests are included in GitHub repo


\section{Conclusions \& Future work}
Some known big ticket items on the horizon for the TSC
- establishing a process and prioritization/selection process for including
new software components
- establish minimum integration test expectations
- establish packaging conventions:
• naming schemes
• dependency hierarchy management • installation paths
• upgrade/rollback? mechanisms
- road map time line for next release (and cadence strategy for future releases)
- addition of public CI infrastructure, roll out of additional architecture builds
