The installation, deployment and configuration of High Performance Computing clusters is a rather tedious work. 
There are various open source and proprietary cluster management tools that attempt to provide a complete solution to this problem.
In the open-source world the most widely known solutions are Rocks and OSCAR.
Rocks \cite{rocks2003,rocks_url}, an open source Linux-based cluster solution package, can significantly reduce the complexity of building HPC clusters.
It provides a specific bundle of software components covering the different administrative needs of a cluster and offers an easy to use GUI
for the different steps of the installation procedure.
All cluster services and tools are installed and configured during the initial installation of the frontend with no need to download and
manual configure other external packages. Furthermore, with the use of Rolls \cite{rolls2004} the administrator can customize the base installation of packages with
additional software that integrate seamlessly and automatically into the management and packaging mechanisms of the base software.
%It makes use of Kickstart and RPM to manage the distribution of node file system and provides component based configuration method to realize module reuse.
The latest and current stable version of Rocks, version 6.2, is based upon CentOS 6.6.

OSCAR \cite{oscar2001,oscar_url} (Open Source Cluster Application Resources) is fully integrated and easy to install software bundle designed for
high performance cluster computing. The fundamental function of OSCAR is to build and maintain clusters. 
OSCAR follows a different methodology than Rocks; once the frontend is installed and booted, the cluster building components are downloaded and installed
through tools that try to simplify the complexity of the different administrative tasks. 
There have been some variations of OSCAR based on the same framework to cover different types of cluster environments such as Thin-Oscar for diskless platforms
and HA-Oscar to support High Availability. OSCAR is supported upon various Linux distributions such as CentOS and Debian. However, even if OSCAR and its 
variations are still being used in production, the project is no longer actively maintained and the latest version 6.1.1 was released in 2011. 
%OSCAR also provides a GUI for installation and configuration purposes.
%OSCAR is based upon a virtual image of the target machine using System Installation Suite (SIS). There is also an OSCAR database (ODA) that stores cluster information, 
%a parallel distributed “shell” tool set called C3 and an environment management facility called Env-Switcher.

OpenHPC is much less automated than Rocks, does not provide a GUI interface, expects a certain expertise from the administrator,
but it offers a greater choice of software components, promoting flexibility, for each level of the software stack. Furthermore
OpenHPC is supported and maintained by a group of vendors, research centers and laboratories that have as common goal standardization through 
sharing of best practices.

%In the proprietary world HPE \cite{hpe-core_url}, Bull \cite{bull-scs_url}, Cray \cite{cray_url}, Intel \cite{intel_url} and 
%others provide complete cluster management solutions. These software environments are usually based 
%upon open-source components with additional proprietary software or added value to support and optimize the specificities of their hardware.
