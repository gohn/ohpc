\subsection{Related Work} \label{sec:related_work}

As highlighted in the previous section, the installation, deployment and
configuration of HPC clusters can be tedious work.  Consequently, a variety of
open source and proprietary cluster management tools have been created that
provide different approaches to help address this problem.  In the open-source
arena, two widely known solutions have been Rocks and OSCAR.  Rocks
\cite{rocks2003,rocks_url} is an open source Linux-based clustering solution
that aims to reduce the complexity of building HPC clusters.  It provides a
combined bundle of an underlying CentOS distribution with additional software
components covering the different administrative needs of a cluster, 
and offers a GUI to help administrators walk thru
different steps of the installation procedure.  All cluster services and tools
are installed and configured during the initial installation of the frontend
with no need to download and %manual
configure other external
packages. Furthermore, with the use of Rolls \cite{rolls2004}, the
administrator can customize the base installation
%of packages
with additional
optional software that integrates seamlessly and automatically into the management and
packaging mechanisms of the base software.
%It makes use of Kickstart and RPM to manage the distribution of node file
%system and provides component based configuration method to realize module
%reuse.
The most recent version of Rocks, version 6.2, was released in May 2015 and is
based upon CentOS~(v6.6).

OSCAR \cite{oscar2001,oscar_url} (Open Source Cluster Application Resources) is
fully integrated and easy to install software bundle designed for high
performance cluster computing. The fundamental function of OSCAR is to build
and maintain clusters.  OSCAR follows a different methodology than Rocks; once
the frontend is installed and booted, the cluster building components are
downloaded and installed through tools that try to simplify the complexity of
the different administrative tasks.  There have been some variations of OSCAR
based on the same framework to cover different types of cluster environments
such as Thin-Oscar for diskless platforms and HA-Oscar to support High
Availability. OSCAR is supported upon various Linux distributions such as
CentOS and Debian. However, even if OSCAR and its variations are still being
used in production, the project is no longer actively maintained and the latest
version 6.1.1 was released in 2011.
%OSCAR also provides a GUI for installation and configuration purposes.  OSCAR
%is based upon a virtual image of the target machine using System Installation
%Suite (SIS). There is also an OSCAR database (ODA) that stores cluster
%information, a parallel distributed “shell” tool set called C3 and an
%environment management facility called Env-Switcher.

OpenHPC is much less automated than Rocks, does not provide a GUI interface,
expects a certain expertise from the administrator, but it offers a greater
choice of software components, promoting flexibility, for each level of the
software stack. Furthermore OpenHPC is supported and maintained by a group of
vendors, research centers and laboratories that have as common goal
standardization through sharing of best practices.
